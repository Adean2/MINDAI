          MIND AI is a 3D interactive website designed to provide a unique
          perspective on the development and potential impacts of artificial
          intelligence in major economic industries. At the heart of the website
          is a 3D model of an AI brain that is linked to the functions and vital
          parts of the human brain. By comparing the two, MIND AI aims to
          educate viewers on how the human brain has influenced the development
          of AI technology and serves as a tool for understanding its
          complexity. Using interactive models and data, MIND AI provides an
          engaging and informative experience that enables users to explore the
          societal impacts of AI in major industries such as Healthcare and
          Education. Each individual AI brain element contains research
          explaining the potential effects for that specific industry. Users
          gain access to this information by clicking on the individual parts.
          The research provided encourages viewers to maintain a balanced
          perspective on this rapidly evolving technology. Artificial
          intelligence can change the world, educating society on its potential
          is the right step to ensuring a future where this technology enhances
          our lives for the better.
